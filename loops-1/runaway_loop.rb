# The code below is an example of an infinite loop. The name describes exactly
# what it does: loop infinitely. This loop isn't useful in a real program,
# though. Modify the code so the loop stops after the first iteration.

#loop do
#  puts 'just keep printing...'
#end

# Solution

loop do
  puts 'just keep printing...'
  break
end
